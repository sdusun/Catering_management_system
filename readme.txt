Catering management system

餐饮管理.dsp
    This file (the project file) contains information at the project level and is used to build a single project or subproject. 

餐饮管理.h
    This is the main header file for the application.  It includes other project specific headers (including Resource.h) and declares the CMyApp application class.

餐饮管理.cpp
    This is the main application source file that contains the application class CMyApp.

餐饮管理.rc
    This is a listing of all of the Microsoft Windows resources that the program uses.  It includes the icons, bitmaps, and cursors that are stored in the RES subdirectory.  This file can be directly edited in Microsoft Visual C++.

餐饮管理.clw
    This file contains information used by ClassWizard to edit existing classes or add new classes.  ClassWizard also uses this file to store information needed to create and edit message maps and dialog data maps and to create prototype member functions.

res\餐饮管理.ico
    This is an icon file, which is used as the application's icon.  This icon is included by the main resource file 餐饮管理.rc.

AppWizard creates one dialog class:

餐饮管理Dlg.h, 餐饮管理Dlg.cpp - the dialog
    This class defines the behavior of your application's main dialog.  The dialog's template is in 餐饮管理.rc, which can be edited in Microsoft Visual C++.

StdAfx.h, StdAfx.cpp
    These files are used to build a precompiled header (PCH) file named 餐饮管理.pch and a precompiled types file named StdAfx.obj.

Resource.h
    This is the standard header file, which defines new resource IDs. Microsoft Visual C++ reads and updates this file.
